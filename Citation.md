# Introduction #
If you want to use the library or some algorithms in your publication, it would be great if you would give a citiation to
  * the auhtor(s) of the algorithm you were using,
  * the JFeatureLib project.

The benefits **for you** when citing the project:
  * Your research is much more reproducible.
  * Reviewers will like this and will more likely accept your paper.
  * Other scientists will more likely compare their work with your paper as it is much easier to compare with your work (= more citations for you!)

Within your work, it is recommended to also mention the version you were using. Maybe a feature has to be changed if a bug was found. Or even worse, maybe a bug shows up in a later version that was not present in the version you were using. In this case, other scientists might not be able to reproduce your results.

## Example ##
"Some features in this paper were used from JFeatureLib \cite{Gra2012}."
```
@ONLINE{Gra2012,
  author = {Graf, Franz},
  title = {JFeatureLib},
  year = {2012},
  url = {https://JFeatureLib.googlecode.com},
  note = "[Online; Version <versionNumber>]"
}
